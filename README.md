## Devlog

The relationship between Components, Game0bjects, and Scenes in Unity is like an art piece. In an art piece, you have a canvas which is the scene, Components which is the paint, and what you decide to make with the paint which are the GameObjecs. I think of Components similarly as ingredients to cook a dish (gameObject), and the final dish to be the scene. If the chef (game developer) wanted to found the dish to be a little to salty, they might want to add some more pepper, or another spice. In unity, they would be changing up the Components of a gameObject to recreate how the object functions. This will then be put into the scene which can be thought of as a dish or painting.
